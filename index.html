	  <h3> Hi! My name is Tiffany Mo and I currently go to JCHS and I am in the 10th grade :) I was born and raised on Oahu despite looking very asian.  I also have two sisters who also go to this school that I often get mistaken for.
        <h3> Some things I am interested in include science and biology, watching movies and tv shows, editing, and makeup/beauty! I have always been interested in science and I might consider majoring in it for college. My favortite tv show is The Office and I love romance or thriller movies. </h3>
        <h3> Other things I like are otters and dogs! I have a grey miniature schnauzer named koko and she is turning 6 years old :) For my more serious interests, I plan on going to college after high school to major in biology, computer science, or psychology. However I'm not sure at all what I would like to do for a living one day. I hope to be able to travel around the world and see places I have never seen before.  </h3></h3>
