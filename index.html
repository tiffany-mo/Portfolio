 <h2> Hi! My name is Tiffany Mo <(￣︶￣)> I currently go to JCHS and I am in the 10th grade! Despite looking very asian and being full chinese, I was shockingly born and raised on Oahu. I also have two sisters who also go to this school that I often get mistaken for.</h2>
        
        <h2>Some things I am interested in include science and biology, film, editing, and makeup/beauty! I have always been interested in science and I am considering majoring in it for college. My favortite tv show is The Office and I love thriller movies.</h2> 
       
       <h2>Other things I like are otters and dogs! I have a grey miniature schnauzer named koko and she is turning 6 years old :) For some of my more serious interests, I plan on going to college after high school to major in biology, computer science, or psychology. I'm not sure at all what I would like to do for a living one day but I hope to be able to travel around the world and see places I have never seen before when I grow up. Making this website was kind of a struggle, so I hope you like it :-)</h2>
